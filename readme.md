interesting stuff:
- clipped provided jpegs with CSS `-webkit-clip-path` from [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip/) and added negative margins to correct positioning
- wrote a getNumber function that makes a new Array for ng-repeat to iterate over and insert font-awesome stars. More [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16824853/way-to-ng-repeat-defined-number-of-times-instead-of-repeating-over-array).
